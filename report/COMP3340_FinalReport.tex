    \textbf{Summary}
    \textit{New City Better Life.} Almost one quarter of Canadians moved or plan to move since April 2020. These survey participants cited COVID-19 as a reason for relocating. We started \textit{New City Better Life} as a way to help this market do their research on possible dream cities so that they can relocate to any city in Canada. On our website, you may get information on 166 of the most livable cities/towns in Canada.
    
    \textbf{Purpose}
    The purpose of our website is to help people who have a plan to move in the future. We provide key livability statistics and information on almost all cities and towns in Canada that can be saved by users and help them make decisions regarding their relocation in the future.
   
    \textbf{Methodology}
    This website was created using the standard LAMP-stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The front-end is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was initially created by carefully planning a sitemap using the project's purpose and background. From this sitemap, we implemented the most important pages by the predicted frequency of use by our potential users, with the index page being the highest priority page to have been implemented. After the most important pages were created (and connected through a working navigation system), we then turned our efforts to the heart of the website's functionality, which was to be able to display database records on dynamic PHP pages and a working login system for admins and clients.

    \textbf{End Result}
    At the end of the semester, we completed an MVP website with the core functionalities and requirements that was needed to make the site operational. It is currently live and running, with users able to register, login and use the site to search for information related to their dream city, while being able to maintain a data-persistent, account-based list of their favorite cities through a logged-in account. The website is also highly-maintainable on the admin side, with high quality documentation for both end-users and admins. Finally, our website and code is open-source on GitHub and is ready to be cloned, deployed and installed by third-party developers who would like to implement our codebase to build similar projects in the future.

% =====================================================================
\section{Open Data Set}

\subsection*{Air Quality Data by Canadian Province}
For our open dataset, we used one of the Government of Canada's official datasets. The data set is from \textit{Environment and Climate Change Canada} deparment, and describes air quality monitoring data gathered by the \textit{National Air Pollution Surveillance Program} (NAPS) from the years 1974 to 2020. To make this dataset more relevant to our audience, we opted to only include data from the most recent year available, 2020.

\subsection*{Dataset URL}
The URL for the complete dataset can be found here \url{https://data-donnees.ec.gc.ca/data/air/monitor/national-air-pollution-surveillance-naps-program/Data-Donnees/?lang=en}.

\subsection*{Code Implementation}
The open dataset was provided in separate CSV files (by city) and was manually reorganized, cleansed and formatted into a single CSV table. The table was then summarized using an Excel pivot table and the data directly applied to a JavaScript data visualization framework (Plotly.js) displayed below to maximize data visualization speed and performance:
